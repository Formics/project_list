Can't really think of any major B2B ideas, one possibility is finding a niche industry that has really bad tech, and no i don't mean a healthcare play cause everyone does that stuff.

Examples of the top of my head are :

Mechanic software, so people can get updates etc on a car appointment. Not sure if there is software like this already but this is the type of thing we would wanna do. Though this is a harder thing to sell cause there are few medium to smaller size places that are willing to do something like this. Mom and Pop stores are reluctant to buy stuff like this.

Another option is to look at what medium sized software companies need there is a bunch of stuff here so I don't know where to start but one of your side projects might be good .

# Schools
School Activities and Clubs Managment Software. If we make a nice UI

Athletic Practice Schedule Creator and Runner - controls the creation of a practice, sharing it with coaches and integerates iwth the service above.

Heartbeat + GPS system for highschool atheltes plus weight trackng for overall health tracking.

# Video Signing
Video singing thing I've been talking about. This is a harder sell but the idea is neat and if it gets popular it will be an insane play since we would be establshing a new checkmark like twitter.

# Something to do with batteries.
Batteries importance are rising and we might find some sort of niche to fill in the world of btb or btc batteries. A battery recycle service or something smarter than that.
