I likked the idea for masternode but it seems to be pretty much done by a bunch of people : 

https://www.allnodes.com/

unless we had an idea to beat them. I'm not sure. 


Tile Servers would be interesting but who are our buyers ? 


Quantam Encryption : What are you a VC fund Justice. Throwing cool words in the air. 


PGP Alternative is pretty intersting, I'm gonna do some reading on that. 

Lol this is no longer a finalist thing but more a me documenting what i am thinking thing. 

VPN Protocol : There is actually a cool thing we can do with this right. We can make a VPN that you spin up on demand. It works by setting up a bunch of nodes in ec2 or google or both and you connect to it and you can shut it down immeidatly when you are done and then can spin up a completly new one. It would be a logless VPN we would only need to figure out how to make the exit nodes not our fault just in case someone does something illegal, one way would be to have someone use an aws key but then what makes it different then a script, maybe settings ? or that we control how stuff is setup ? We can use RabbitMQ or another quing mechanism to daisy chain stuff to and basically make it redudant to failure since if a message doesn't make it to one queue we would know?
