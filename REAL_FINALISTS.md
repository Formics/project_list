What I think are viable ( and please tell me what you think ). 

School Based software. -> this is just django and some websocket + sms stuff . Not insanely techincal but imo marketable and more importantly sellable. 

PGP Alternative. -> A cool techincal challenge that is definaitly sellable to the right clients. 

Video Siging -> No idea if this is sellabe but techincally super cool

AOSP Distributed Build -> pretty cool and not sure if there is a good solution for this yet. + if we can guarntee some sort of anomonity or security of what is being built ? Ie make final build live in local cpu or something like that so companies like RI would use it.
